# 🧠 Multi-Agent AI Fitness App – Built with Python, Langflow, Astra DB & Streamlit

Hey everyone! 👋

In this project, I'm building one of the **most advanced multi-agent AI applications** on my channel so far — a smart, fitness-focused AI app powered by **multiple LLMs**, intelligent task routing, and a full interactive frontend using **Streamlit**.

This isn't just a basic chatbot. We're diving deep into building an actual **multi-agent system** where each agent (LLM) handles different tasks — from workout planning to nutritional advice — and all of it is tied together in a powerful backend and smooth user interface.

## 📹 What This Tutorial Covers

In the full video walkthrough, I’ll be covering:
- Setting up multi-agent LLM architecture in **Python**
- Using **Langflow** to manage agent workflows
- Connecting to **Astra DB** for vector storage
- Designing a **Streamlit frontend** for user interaction
- Routing tasks to the right LLM based on user input
- And much more 🔥

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** – backend and logic
- **Langflow** – visual and code-based flow of agents
- **Astra DB** – for memory and vector data
- **Streamlit** – clean and fast frontend interface
- **Multiple LLMs** – OpenAI, and others (customizable)

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 Multi-agent intelligence (workouts, nutrition, recovery, etc.)
- 🔀 Dynamic LLM routing based on task type
- 🧠 Persistent memory using vector DB
- 💬 Streamlit frontend for live interaction
- 📦 Modular structure to expand agent capabilities easily
